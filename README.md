# Diabetes-Prediction-using-ANN-with-Pytorch_Module
The Aim of this project is to  predict patient is suffering from diabetes or not from various parameters. Here dependent variable (Outcome) is binary.
We have created an  Artificial Neural Network model using Pytorch module with which we were able to define our feed forward neural network method, optimizer, loss function and backward propogation method. The model was also tested with new set of input
